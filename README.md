# APP-Team-REST-API

My submission to UNC App Team's backend developer take home assignment.

The REST API is written in [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), and uses [Spring](https://spring.io/) as its framework. 
I also [scraped](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/yelp-scraper/cbmhmapejkobbbmhdlpjmiljbfgnfknc?hl=en)
Yelp review data to populate my API's database with the top 100 most popular restaurants in Chapel Hill, taking into
account their ratings and price range ("$"-"$$$").

Before this I had never made an API, I didn't know what REST API meant, and had never touched Spring.
I am thankful for all this opportunity has taught me: I can finally spell restuarant.
